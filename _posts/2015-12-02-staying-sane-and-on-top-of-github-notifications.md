![How my Notification Settings look like](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9ba99eacaa3ea6a1f2893f9dd9a901d445894afc.png)

On a quest for simplicity, we, recently ditched all additional tools and moved all our planning over to GitHub, where we've also been organizing our code. Quick conversations still happen on Slack, but we'll increasingly spend time talking in GitHub issues.

I'm guessing here -- but at The Grid we probably have around one hundred repositories in our GitHub organization. On any given day we receive dozens of notifications on GitHub. It's not always easy to stay on top of those. For a communications system to function, messages must not get lost or overlooked. If we stop replying to important messages, people wait, cycles are burned and progress slows down -- we are not working efficiently.

Now GitHub doesn't do a very good job to help me prioritize notifications. It's easy to miss important messages that need a timely reply. It doesn't have a priority inbox like GMail, and the GitHub web interface doesn't even reveal what a notification is about. All I see is that _something_ happened in some issue in some repository.

**Here's what I do**

I unwatch repositories I don't care about. Actually, you should probably do a clean cut right now, unwatch all repositories and re-watch only those really important to you. I do, however, have _Automatic Watching_ enabled. When a repository is created, I'll receive a notification and can unwatch immediately if I want.

I enabled email notifications for threads I'm participating or I'm being _@mentioned_ in. There are probably only a handful of those threads at a time, so this makes me confident I don't miss anything. Big plus: replies to an email notification end up as comments on GitHub. This lets me quickly answer to multiple threads in multiple repositories without clicking around on GitHub.

I disabled email notifications for everything else to reduce the noise. I still opted to receive on-site notifications, as the little blue indicator is easy enough to ignore.
