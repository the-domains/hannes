# The reasons I like working with Android

## The tools

Android Studio is too good to be true. The underlying IntelliJ IDEA is one of the most magic pieces of software around. The Gradle Build system is both fast (well okay, it could be a lot faster), easy to use and seems to be constantly improved by an awesome team. A team that, by the way, is not hidden behind secured doors and NDAs, but part of the community. Ever tried to reach out to an Xcode developer on Twitter, and gotten a reply?

## The design

Material Design is more than long shadows and bold colors. A set of coherent metaphors.
